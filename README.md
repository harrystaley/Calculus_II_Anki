# Calculus_II_Anki

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Calculus_II_Anki repository! This project is a collaborative Anki deck specifically tailored for students and educators involved in Calculus II. The deck is compiled using high-quality resources such as Paul's Online Notes, Wikipedia, and MIT OpenCourseWare. The mathematical expressions within the deck are beautifully rendered using LaTeX and MathJax to enhance learning and retention.

The structure of this repository is designed to facilitate easy navigation and contribution:
- **/decks/**: Contains the main Anki deck file that can be imported directly into Anki.
- **/resources/**: Documentation and links to the source materials used for creating the deck.
- **/scripts/**: Utility scripts to help maintain and update the deck.
