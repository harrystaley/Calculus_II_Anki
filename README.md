# Calculus_II_Anki

## Project Overview
Calculus_II_Anki is a collaborative Anki deck for Calculus II, aimed at providing high-quality, comprehensive study materials for students and enthusiasts. The deck is sourced from reputable materials such as Paul's Online Notes, Wikipedia, and MIT OpenCourseWare. It utilizes LaTeX and MathJax for formula display, ensuring the complex mathematical concepts are represented accurately and clearly. 

This project was born out of the need for a comprehensive, easy-to-understand, and accessible study tool for Calculus II. We welcome and encourage contributions to enhance the deck, with guidelines available in this repository.
